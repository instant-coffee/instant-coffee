Hey! I am a product engineer, based on Vancouver Island, with strong engineering fundamentals and a deep appreciation for visual storytelling. 

My strengths are combining craft-focused UI development with clear, structured thinking. I’m comfortable owning ambiguous problems end-to-end—prototyping, validating, collaborating cross-functionally, and shipping improvements tied to measurable outcomes.

I also have strong instincts around systems and architecture. 

> A personal project of mine: I’m resto-modding a 40-year-old Range Rover. A vehicle like that is a collection of interdependent systems, and nothing behaves the way it did off the factory floor. You can’t just replace parts; you have to understand the underlying constraints, isolate failure points, and design creative solutions that work within the whole system.

That mindset carries into my engineering work. I enjoy untangling complexity, mapping out how each piece interacts, and deciding where to optimize versus where to triage. Sometimes you need a pragmatic fix so the system can move forward—then you come back later to refine it. Other times you step back, redesign the architecture, and eliminate entire classes of problems.

Whether I’m debugging an onboarding flow or re-wiring an old Rover, the approach is the same: clarify the system, identify opportunities for improvement, make thoughtful tradeoffs, and build something reliable and intentional.
