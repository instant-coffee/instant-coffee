# Hey!
### I’m a product-minded engineer based on Vancouver Island, blending strong engineering fundamentals with a deep appreciation for visual storytelling and thoughtful user experience.

## About Me

My strengths sit at the intersection of craft-focused UI engineering and clear, structured thinking. I’m comfortable owning ambiguous problems end-to-end—prototyping ideas, validating them, collaborating across teams, and shipping improvements tied to measurable outcomes.

I also have strong instincts around systems and architecture.

> A personal project: I’m resto-modding a 40-year-old Range Rover. A vehicle like that is a bundle of interconnected systems, all aging in their own ways. You can’t just swap parts; you have to understand constraints, isolate failure points, and design fixes that work with the whole.

That same mindset shapes my engineering work. I enjoy untangling complexity, mapping how pieces interact, and choosing when to optimize, when to patch, and when to redesign from the ground up.

Whether it’s debugging an onboarding flow or re-wiring an old Rover, the process is the same: clarify the system, identify opportunities, make deliberate tradeoffs, and build something reliable and intentional.

## Currently

- Building a new personal site using Vue.js and modern tooling  
- Exploring UX engineering patterns in motion, narrative interfaces, and calm technology  
- Running a Raspberry Pi RoverGauge + diagnostics build  
- Sharpening product thinking through small PLG-focused experiments
