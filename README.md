Hey! I am a dev based on Vancouver Island, Canada

Craft-focused product engineer with strong engineering fundamentals and a deep appreciation for visual storytelling. I build thoughtful, maintainable, and scalable interfaces using modern frameworks. My experience spans billing and onboarding flows, analytics visualizations, branded interactive experiences, and creative tools, each demanding clarity, reliability, and aesthetic polish.

I excel in async-first product development environments where quality, reliability, and iteration speed matter. Partnering closely with peers, composing well-tested code, and contributing to shared UI systems. I’m motivated by open collaboration, purposeful engineering, and building tools that help teams work more effectively.
